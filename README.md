 ## Frontend Task: Develop an E-commerce Website using FakeStoreAPI

## Objective:

Create an e-commerce website with basic functionalities such as displaying products on the homepage, showing detailed information about each product, and allowing users to add items to their cart.

## Requirements:

## Homepage:

Fetch data from the FakeStoreAPI to display a list of products on the homepage.

Display essential information for each product (e.g., image, title, price).

Each product should be clickable, leading to its details page.

## Details Page:

Upon clicking a product on the homepage, navigate to a details page for that product.

Fetch detailed information about the selected product from the API (e.g., description, category).

Display all relevant details about the product.

## Cart Functionality:

Implement a cart feature that allows users to add products to their cart.

Provide buttons or actions on both the homepage and the details page to add items to the cart.

Display the current contents of the cart, including product names, quantities, and total price.

Allow users to remove items from the cart or adjust quantities as needed.

## Additional Guidelines:

Compose your code independently rather than relying on AI or code from others.

Use React.js for the frontend development.

Utilize React Router for navigation between different pages.

Design the website to be responsive and user-friendly.

Implement error handling for API requests and edge cases (e.g., empty responses).

Write clean, well-documented code with proper comments.

Utilize modern best practices and consider code scalability and maintainability.
